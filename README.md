# BNetClassiChat_GUI
GUI client for battle.net's classic chat API. Requires an API key from Blizzard to connect. API keys can be requested from Blizzard at https://us.battle.net/forums/en/bnet/topic/20754336617?page=1. Currently a beta release. Does not yet support all features of the API and will probably contain bugs.

# Build requirements
Visual Studio 2017 and .NET Framework 4.6.2
